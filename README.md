# üöÄ LLM Fine-Tuning with LoRA and QLoRA using VEXT

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using LoRA and QLoRA techniques with VEXT for the LLM pipeline.

## Overview

Fine-tuning large language models can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) are techniques designed to make this process more efficient by reducing the number of parameters to be fine-tuned. This repository demonstrates how to implement these techniques using the VEXT framework for LLM pipelines.

## üìù Introduction

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks can improve their performance in specialized applications. LoRA and QLoRA are methods that enable more efficient fine-tuning by adapting only a small subset of the model's parameters. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to using these techniques with the VEXT framework to fine-tune LLMs.

## üîç LoRA and QLoRA

### LoRA

LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation, a method that reduces the number of trainable parameters by injecting trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of the model. This significantly decreases the computational requirements for fine-tuning.

### QLoRA

QLoRA stands for Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation. It extends LoRA by quantizing the low-rank matrices, further reducing the memory footprint and computational cost while maintaining model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è VEXT for LLM Pipeline

VEXT is a versatile and extensible framework for building and managing LLM pipelines. It provides tools for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. This repository leverages VEXT to streamline the fine-tuning process with LoRA and QLoRA.

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-finetuning-lora-qlora.git
    cd llm-finetuning-lora-qlora
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### üìÇ Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset in the required format. Ensure your data is cleaned and preprocessed according to the task you are fine-tuning the model for.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Fine-Tuning

1. **Configure the fine-tuning parameters**:
   - Edit the configuration file `config.yaml` to specify the model, dataset, and fine-tuning parameters.

2. **Run the fine-tuning script**:
    ```bash
    python fine_tune.py --config config.yaml
    ```

### üß™ Evaluation

1. **Run the evaluation script**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/fine-tuned-model --data_path path/to/evaluation-dataset
    ```
